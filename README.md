# Mips2Machine
Made out of spite for converting multiple lines of mips assembly into machine code
Should eventually be able to convert multiple lines of mips assembly to machine code in hex or binary, with things like branch and j calculations.
Part 1:
implement all functions under the "000000" opcode
part 2:
add remaining opcodes (excluding operations that involve pc jumping) and begin working on PC implemtation
part 3:
fully implement pc jumping opcodes
